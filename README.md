# CryptoCoins

This project is for the Fullstack Web Development course I am taking at John Bryce college. 
The object of this project is to display real live information about crypto coins (such as bitcoin), by using a remote API. 

Some of the features in this website are:

	* Displaying 300 coins (out of 6000)
	* Displaying extra information on each coin (image and currency rates) 
	* Searching for specific coins and displaying them (if found)
	* Choosing up to 5 coins and displaying a live report regarding currency rate (specifically USD)

The technologies I used:

	* HTML5
	* CSS3
	* Java Script
	* Bootstrap
	* jQuery
